        In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the
        ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down
        on or to eat: it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort.
        It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob
        in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable
        tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished
        chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel
        wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill The Hill, as all the
        people for many miles round called it and many little round doors opened out of it, first on
        one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars,
        pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens,
        dining rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms
        were all on the left hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows,
        deep set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the
        river.
        This hobbit was a very well to do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had
        lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very
        respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any
        adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any
        question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,
        found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the
        neighbours' respect, but he gained well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
